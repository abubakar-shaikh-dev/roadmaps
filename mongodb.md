## Introduction to NoSQL and MongoDB 🌱

- What is NoSQL and its advantages
- Understanding the document-based nature of MongoDB
- Key concepts like collections, documents, and fields

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Install MongoDB and connect to a local MongoDB server.

## Installing MongoDB ⚙️

- Installing MongoDB on different operating systems
- Running a standalone MongoDB server
- Interacting with MongoDB through the command-line client

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Start and stop the MongoDB server, and explore the MongoDB shell.

## Basic CRUD Operations 📝

- Creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents
- Inserting data into collections
- Updating documents and using upserts

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a collection and perform basic CRUD operations on sample data.

## Querying Data 📊

- Using various query operators in MongoDB
- Querying with projection and sorting
- Combining multiple conditions in queries

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write queries to retrieve specific documents from a collection.

## Indexes and Aggregations 🔍

- Creating indexes to optimize query performance
- Understanding aggregation pipelines and operators
- Using $group, $match, $project, and other aggregation stages

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create indexes on fields and perform aggregation queries.

## Data Modeling 🧩

- Understanding data modeling in MongoDB
- Embedding vs. referencing related data
- Denormalization and trade-offs

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Design a data model for a simple e-commerce application.

## Schema Design 🏗️

- Schema design best practices in MongoDB
- Handling schema changes and migrations
- Choosing appropriate data types for fields

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Refine the data model and schema for the e-commerce application.

## Data Validation 📐

- Implementing validation rules with JSON Schema
- Enforcing data integrity and constraints
- Validating data on insert and update operations

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Add validation rules to ensure data integrity in the e-commerce application.

## Transactions and Concurrency ❌

- Understanding transactions in MongoDB
- Managing concurrent read and write operations
- Ensuring data consistency with transactions

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement a transactional process for order processing.

## Performance Tuning ⚡️

- Analyzing and optimizing query performance
- Using the explain() method for query analysis
- Hardware and configuration considerations

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Identify and optimize slow-running queries in the application.

## Replication and Sharding 🔄

- Configuring replica sets for high availability
- Scaling horizontally with sharding
- Managing data distribution across shards

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Set up a replica set and shard a collection in MongoDB.

## Backup and Restore 🗄️

- Creating backups and snapshots of MongoDB data
- Restoring data from backups and snapshots
- Backup strategies for different scenarios

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a backup of the e-commerce application's database and restore it.

## Security 🔒

- Securing MongoDB deployments
- User authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Configure authentication and access control for the application's database.

## Working with MongoDB and a Programming Language (e.g., Node.js) 🚀

- Using MongoDB drivers and libraries with a programming language
- Interacting with MongoDB through code
- Error handling and best practices

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Set up a Node.js application that communicates with MongoDB.

## Mini Project Tasks 🛠️

1. **Blog Application**: Build a simple blog application with MongoDB as the database backend.

2. **E-commerce Platform**: Create an e-commerce platform that uses MongoDB for product and order management.

3. **Social Media API**: Develop a RESTful API for a social media platform using MongoDB.

4. **Real-time Chat Application**: Build a real-time chat application with MongoDB and a WebSocket library.

5. **Task Manager**: Implement a task manager application with MongoDB for task storage and management.
