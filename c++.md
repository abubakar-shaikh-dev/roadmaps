## Introduction 🌱

- What is C++ and its history
- Setting up a C++ development environment
- Writing and compiling a basic C++ program

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a simple "Hello, World!" program in C++.

## Basic Syntax 🖋️

- Structure of a C++ program
- Comments and whitespace
- Writing and using functions

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Develop a C++ program to find the factorial of a given number.

## Data Types and Variables 🔢

- Basic data types (int, float, char, etc.)
- Modifiers (signed, unsigned, short, long)
- Constants and literals

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write a program to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## Operators 🧮

- Arithmetic, relational, and logical operators
- Bitwise and assignment operators
- Ternary operator (conditional operator)

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Build a program to perform basic calculator operations.

## Control Statements 🔀

- If-else statements
- Switch-case statements
- Loops (for, while, do-while)

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Develop a program to check whether a number is prime or not.

## Functions 📋

- Creating and calling functions
- Passing arguments to functions
- Function overloading and default arguments

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write a program to find the factorial of a number using recursion and iteration.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 🏛️

- Classes and objects in C++
- Constructors and destructors
- Inheritance and polymorphism

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a "Bank Account" class with inheritance for savings and checking accounts.

## Arrays and Strings 🎵

- Declaring and using arrays
- Manipulating strings and string functions

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement a program to reverse a given string and find its length.

## Pointers and References 🔍

- Understanding pointers and memory addresses
- Pointers to functions and objects
- Using references for pass-by-reference

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a program to swap two numbers using pointers and references.

## File Handling 🗃️

- Reading from and writing to files
- Working with file streams

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Develop a program to read data from a file and display its contents.

## Templates 📚

- Creating and using function templates
- Class templates and template specialization

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write a generic program to find the maximum element in an array using templates.

## Standard Template Library (STL) 📚

- Containers (vector, list, map, etc.)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)
- Iterators and STL functions

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement a program using STL containers and algorithms to manipulate data.

## Exception Handling ❌

- Handling exceptions in C++ programs
- Try-catch blocks and throwing exceptions

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Develop a program with exception handling for handling divide-by-zero scenarios.

## Multithreading 🚀

- Introduction to multithreading in C++
- Creating and managing threads
- Synchronization using mutex and condition variables

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Build a program that demonstrates multithreading and thread synchronization.

## C++11, C++14, and C++17 Features 🎛️

- Overview of new features introduced in C++11, C++14, and C++17
- Lambda expressions, smart pointers, and more

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Utilize C++11 or newer features in one of your previous projects.

## Mini Project Tasks 🛠️

1. **Bank Management System**: Create a program to manage bank accounts, transactions, and customers.

2. **Library Management**: Implement a library management system with book records and borrowing functionality.

3. **Student Gradebook**: Develop a program to store and calculate student grades and GPAs.

4. **Text-based Adventure Game**: Create an interactive text-based adventure game with choices and consequences.

5. **Employee Database**: Build a program to manage employee records and salaries.
