## Introduction to Databases 🌱

- What are databases and their importance
- Relational databases vs. other types of databases
- Basic concepts like tables, rows, and columns

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Set up MySQL on your system and create a sample database.

## Installing MySQL ⚙️

- Installing MySQL on different operating systems
- Setting up the root password and user accounts
- Using the MySQL command-line client

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Install MySQL and access the MySQL shell.

## Creating Databases and Tables 🗄️

- Creating databases in MySQL
- Designing and creating tables
- Using data types and constraints

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Design and create a database schema for a simple blog application.

## Data Types and Constraints 🔢

- Understanding data types in MySQL
- Using constraints for data validation
- Primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Define tables for a bookstore database with appropriate data types and constraints.

## Inserting Data 📝

- Inserting single and multiple rows into tables
- Inserting data with explicit column names
- Handling auto-increment columns

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Insert sample data into your bookstore database tables.

## Querying Data with SELECT 📊

- Retrieving data from a single table
- Using SELECT with WHERE and ORDER BY clauses
- Querying with aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write queries to retrieve book information from the bookstore database.

## Filtering Data with WHERE 🔍

- Using comparison and logical operators in WHERE
- Combining multiple conditions with AND and OR
- Handling NULL values in queries

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Retrieve specific books based on certain conditions using the WHERE clause.

## Sorting and Limiting Results 🔀

- Sorting data with ORDER BY
- Limiting the number of rows returned with LIMIT
- Combining ORDER BY and LIMIT

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Sort books in the bookstore database and fetch only a limited number of records.

## Updating and Deleting Data 🔄

- Modifying data with UPDATE statements
- Removing data with DELETE statements
- Caution and best practices for updating and deleting

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement functionality to update and delete book records in the bookstore database.

## Joins 🧩

- Understanding different types of JOIN (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, etc.)
- Joining multiple tables to retrieve related data
- Self-joins and subqueries

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Fetch book details along with their authors from multiple related tables.

## Aggregate Functions 📊

- Using aggregate functions for data analysis
- Grouping data with GROUP BY
- Filtering aggregated data with HAVING

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Calculate and display statistics like the total number of books and authors.

## Indexes 🔍

- Understanding indexes and their importance
- Creating and managing indexes in MySQL
- Using indexes for query optimization

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Add indexes to appropriate columns in the bookstore database tables.

## Views 🖼️

- Creating views for simplifying complex queries
- Updating and deleting data through views
- Benefits and limitations of using views

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a view that displays information about books and their authors.

## Stored Procedures and Functions 📦

- Writing and executing stored procedures
- Using parameters and variables in procedures
- Creating and invoking stored functions

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write a stored procedure to update book prices based on certain criteria.

## Transactions ❌

- Understanding database transactions and their properties (ACID)
- Using START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK
- Managing transactions in application code

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement a transactional process for book purchases and updates.

## Database Design and Normalization 🏗️

- Principles of database design and normalization
- Reducing data redundancy with normalization
- Applying normalization rules to a database

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Normalize the database schema for the bookstore application.

## Backup and Restore 🗄️

- Creating backups and snapshots of MySQL data
- Restoring data from backups and snapshots
- Backup strategies for different scenarios

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a backup of the bookstore database and restore it.

## Mini Project Tasks 🛠️

1. **Blog Application**: Build a simple blog application with MySQL as the database backend.

2. **E-commerce Platform**: Create an e-commerce platform that uses MySQL for product and order management.

3. **Social Media API**: Develop a RESTful API for a social media platform using MySQL.

4. **Real-time Chat Application**: Build a real-time chat application with MySQL and a WebSocket library.

5. **Task Manager**: Implement a task manager application with MySQL for task storage and management.
