**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Connect your "Todo App" to an API and store tasks on the server.

## Redux 🔄

- Understanding Redux principles and data flow
- Actions, reducers, and the Redux store
- Connecting React components to Redux

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Integrate Redux into your "Todo App" for state management.

## Context API 🌐

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Optimize the rendering of your app using React.memo and performance testing.

## Server-side Rendering 🌐

- Understanding server-side rendering (SSR)
- Using Next.js or other SSR frameworks

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Convert a React app to a Next.js app for server-side rendering.

## Authentication and Authorization 🔐

- Implementing authentication in React apps
- Managing user sessions and access control

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a "Login and Registration" system with protected routes.
