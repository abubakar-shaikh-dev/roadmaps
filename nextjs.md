## Basics

- Server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR)
- Pages and routing in Next.js
- Data fetching with `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps`
- Dynamic routing with `[slug].js` and `[id].js`
- CSS-in-JS with styled-components or other libraries

## Advanced Routing and Navigation

- Nested routing with nested folders and `useRouter`
- Custom 404 page handling
- Navigation using `Link` and `router.push`
- URL parameters and query strings
- Client-side navigation with `next/link`

## Data Fetching and APIs

- Fetching data from external APIs
- Handling data with `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and `getStaticPaths`
- Handling API routes with `pages/api`

## State Management

- Using React's built-in state management
- Introducing Redux, MobX, or Recoil for more complex applications

## Authentication and Authorization

- Implementing user authentication in Next.js
- Handling private routes and access control

## Optimizations

- Performance optimization techniques
- Image optimization with `next/image`
- Code splitting and dynamic imports
- Caching and data revalidation

## Internationalization (i18n)

- Implementing multi-language support
- Handling content translation

## Deployment

- Deploying Next.js applications to Vercel, Netlify, or other platforms
- Server deployment vs. static site deployment

## Testing

- Writing unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration testing with Cypress

## Advanced Concepts

- Serverless functions
- Custom server and API routes
- WebSockets integration
- GraphQL integration with Apollo or Relay

## Real-world Project

Build a complete Next.js application incorporating all the concepts learned.

Remember that the best way to learn is by practice. Work on small projects and gradually increase complexity. Refer to the Next.js official documentation and community resources for more in-depth explanations and examples.

Happy learning!
