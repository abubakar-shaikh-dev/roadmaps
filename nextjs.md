## Basics

- Server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR)
- Pages and routing in Next.js
- Data fetching with `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps`
- Dynamic routing with `[slug].js` and `[id].js`
- CSS-in-JS with styled-components or other libraries

## Advanced Routing and Navigation

- Nested routing with nested folders and `useRouter`
- Custom 404 page handling
- Navigation using `Link` and `router.push`
- URL parameters and query strings
- Client-side navigation with `next/link`

## Data Fetching and APIs

- Fetching data from external APIs
- Handling data with `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and `getStaticPaths`
- Handling API routes with `pages/api`

## State Management

- Using React's built-in state management
- Introducing Redux, MobX, or Recoil for more complex applications

## Authentication and Authorization

- Implementing user authentication in Next.js
- Handling private routes and access control

## Optimizations

- Performance optimization techniques
- Image optimization with `next/image`
- Code splitting and dynamic imports
- Caching and data revalidation

## Internationalization (i18n)

- Implementing multi-language support
- Handling content translation

## Deployment

- Deploying Next.js applications to Vercel, Netlify, or other platforms
- Server deployment vs. static site deployment

## Testing

- Writing unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration testing with Cypress

## Advanced Concepts

- Serverless functions
- Custom server and API routes
- WebSockets integration
- GraphQL integration with Apollo or Relay

## Real-world Projects

1. **Personal Portfolio**: Create a portfolio website showcasing your skills, projects, and contact information using Next.js's static site generation (SSG) features.

2. **Todo App**: Build a simple todo application with CRUD functionality. Use local state or a simple state management library like React's `useState` to manage tasks.

3. **Weather App**: Create a weather app that fetches weather data from an external API and displays current weather conditions based on the user's location or a manually entered city.

4. **E-commerce Store**: Build an e-commerce store with product listings, shopping cart functionality, and checkout process. Implement dynamic routing for product pages.

5. **Blog Platform**: Develop a blog platform with user authentication and authorization for creating, editing, and deleting blog posts. Use `getServerSideProps` for server-side rendering of blog posts.

6. **Social Media Dashboard**: Create a social media dashboard that pulls data from various social media APIs and presents them in a unified dashboard. Use `SWR` for data fetching and real-time updates.

7. **Real-time Chat Application**: Build a real-time chat application using WebSockets for instant messaging between users. Use Next.js for both server-side and client-side rendering.

8. **Issue Tracker**: Create an issue tracking system where users can report issues, comment, and track the progress of issue resolutions. Implement custom server routes for API endpoints.

9. **Online Code Editor**: Develop an online code editor that supports multiple programming languages. Users can write, run, and share their code with others.

10. **Music Streaming Service**: Build a music streaming service where users can browse, search, and play songs. Use a state management library like Redux to manage audio playback state.
