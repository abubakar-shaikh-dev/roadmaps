## Basics 🌱

- Variables and data types
- Operators and expressions
- Conditional statements
- Loops

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Control Flow and Loops 🔀

- If...else statements
- Switch statements
- For loop
- While loop
- Break and continue statements

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Build a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user can play against the computer.

## Functions 🎛️

- Function declaration and expression
- Parameters and arguments
- Return statement
- Arrow functions

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.

## Arrays 📚

- Creating and accessing arrays
- Array methods (push, pop, shift, unshift, etc.)
- Iterating arrays (forEach, map, filter, reduce, etc.)

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement a "To-Do List" where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed using arrays.

## Objects 🗂️

- Creating and accessing objects
- Object properties and methods
- Object destructuring

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a simple "Library" app to manage book records using objects.

## DOM Manipulation 🌐

- Selecting DOM elements
- Modifying DOM elements (textContent, innerHTML, etc.)
- Event handling

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Build a "Countdown Timer" that updates in real-time and displays a message when the time is up.

## Asynchronous JavaScript ⏳

- Callback functions
- Promises
- Async/await

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Develop a "Random Quote Generator" that fetches quotes from an API using promises or async/await.

## ES6+ Features ✨

- Let and const
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Destructuring
- Spread and rest operators

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Convert a previous project's ES5 code to use modern ES6+ features.

## Modules and Bundlers 📦

- Export and import modules
- CommonJS vs. ES modules
- Using Webpack or Parcel to bundle scripts

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a "Weather App" with separate modules for API fetching, data manipulation, and rendering.

## Error Handling ❌

- try...catch statements
- Custom error handling

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Enhance a previous project with error handling for user inputs and unexpected API responses.

## Testing 🧪

- Writing unit tests with Jest
- Mocking and assertions

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write unit tests for a function in one of your previous projects using Jest.

## Regular Expressions 🔍

- Creating and using regular expressions
- Pattern matching and manipulation

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement a "Password Strength Checker" using regular expressions to validate strong passwords.

## Data Structures and Algorithms 🗄️

- Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues
- Searching and sorting algorithms (binary search, bubble sort, etc.)

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Solve a classic problem like "Fibonacci Series" or "Factorial" using recursion and iteration.

## Functional Programming 🔗

- Higher-order functions
- Map, filter, and reduce functions
- Pure functions and immutability

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a "Shopping Cart" with functional programming principles to handle cart items and calculations.

## Design Patterns 🎨

- Singleton pattern
- Observer pattern
- Factory pattern

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement the "Observer pattern" to handle real-time updates in a chat application.
