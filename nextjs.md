## Basics 🌱

- Server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR)
- Pages and routing in Next.js
- Data fetching with `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps`
- Dynamic routing with `[slug].js` and `[id].js`
- CSS-in-JS with styled-components or other libraries

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a simple static website with multiple pages using Next.js. Implement a navigation bar to move between pages. Use CSS-in-JS for styling.

## Advanced Routing and Navigation 🗺️

- Nested routing with nested folders and `useRouter`
- Custom 404 page handling
- Navigation using `Link` and `router.push`
- URL parameters and query strings
- Client-side navigation with `next/link`

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Build a blog website with multiple nested categories and posts. Implement custom 404 pages for invalid URLs. Use dynamic routing for each blog post page.

## Data Fetching and APIs 📡

- Fetching data from external APIs
- Handling data with `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and `getStaticPaths`
- Handling API routes with `pages/api`

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a "Bookstore" app that fetches book data from an external API and displays it. Implement server-side rendering to show book details on individual pages.

## State Management 🔄

- Using React's built-in state management
- Introducing Redux, MobX, or Recoil for more complex applications

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Develop a "Todo List" application using Next.js. Implement state management to add, edit, and delete tasks.

## Authentication and Authorization 🔐

- Implementing user authentication in Next.js
- Handling private routes and access control

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Build a "Login and Registration" system. Create private routes that require authentication to access certain pages.

## Optimizations ⚡

- Performance optimization techniques
- Image optimization with `next/image`
- Code splitting and dynamic imports
- Caching and data revalidation

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Optimize a large image-heavy website for performance. Use `next/image` and implement code splitting to load resources only when needed.

## Internationalization (i18n) 🌐

- Implementing multi-language support
- Handling content translation

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Develop a "Language Switcher" component that allows users to switch between different languages on the website.

## Deployment 🚀

- Deploying Next.js applications to Vercel, Netlify, or other platforms
- Server deployment vs. static site deployment

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Deploy one of your previous projects to a hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify.

## Testing 🧪

- Writing unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration testing with Cypress

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write unit tests for a simple React component in one of your previous projects.

## Advanced Concepts 🚀🚀

- Serverless functions
- Custom server and API routes
- WebSockets integration
- GraphQL integration with Apollo or Relay

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement a real-time chat feature using WebSockets in your existing project.

## Real-world Projects 🌍

1. **Personal Portfolio**: Create a portfolio website showcasing your skills, projects, and contact information using Next.js's static site generation (SSG) features.

2. **E-commerce Store**: Build an e-commerce store with product listings, shopping cart functionality, and checkout process. Implement dynamic routing for product pages.

3. **Social Media Dashboard**: Create a social media dashboard that pulls data from various social media APIs and presents them in a unified dashboard. Use `SWR` for data fetching and real-time updates.

4. **Issue Tracker**: Create an issue tracking system where users can report issues, comment, and track the progress of issue resolutions. Implement custom server routes for API endpoints.

5. **Online Code Editor**: Develop an online code editor that supports multiple programming languages. Users can write, run, and share their code with others.

6. **Music Streaming Service**: Build a music streaming service where users can browse, search, and play songs. Use a state management library like Redux to manage audio playback state.

Remember, the key to mastering Next.js is practice and building real projects. Start with the basic projects, gradually move to intermediate ones, and challenge yourself with advanced projects as you gain confidence.

Happy coding! 😊🚀
