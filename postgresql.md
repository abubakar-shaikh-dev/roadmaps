## Introduction to Databases 🌱

- What is a database and its importance
- Understanding relational databases and their components
- Basic concepts of data modeling and normalization

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Install PostgreSQL and set up a database server.

## Getting Started with PostgreSQL ⚙️

- Connecting to PostgreSQL server using psql or a GUI tool
- Creating databases, users, and roles in PostgreSQL
- Managing database schemas and extensions

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a new database and user using psql or a GUI tool.

## Basic SQL Queries 🐘

- Learning SQL syntax and keywords
- Performing SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations
- Using WHERE clause and logical operators

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data in a table.

## Filtering and Sorting Data 🔍

- Filtering data using the WHERE clause
- Sorting query results with ORDER BY
- Using LIMIT and OFFSET for pagination

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create queries to filter and sort data based on specific conditions.

## Data Manipulation 📝

- Working with data using aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
- Grouping data with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- Writing subqueries and correlated subqueries

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write queries to perform data manipulation and retrieve aggregated results.

## Joins and Relationships 🔄

- Understanding table relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Performing different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.)
- Using foreign keys and cascading actions

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write queries to retrieve data from related tables using joins.

## Indexes and Optimization 📊

- Creating and using indexes to improve query performance
- Analyzing query plans and identifying performance bottlenecks
- Using EXPLAIN to optimize queries

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create and use indexes to optimize queries.

## Constraints and Triggers 🎛️

- Implementing constraints to enforce data integrity
- Creating and using triggers for automated actions
- Using rules and stored procedures in PostgreSQL

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement constraints and triggers for a specific scenario.

## Views and Materialized Views 🖥️

- Creating views to simplify complex queries
- Understanding materialized views and their benefits
- Refreshing and maintaining materialized views

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a view and a materialized view for data retrieval.

## Transactions and Locking 🗝️

- Working with transactions and ACID properties
- Understanding PostgreSQL's isolation levels
- Managing locks for concurrency control

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement a transaction to ensure data consistency.

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs) 🧩

- Using CTEs to simplify complex queries
- Recursive CTEs for hierarchical data
- Understanding when to use CTEs

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write queries using Common Table Expressions.

## Window Functions 🪟

- Understanding window functions and their uses
- Using OVER clause for partitioning and ordering
- Performing calculations with window functions

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Utilize window functions for data analysis.

## Full-Text Search 🔍

- Configuring and performing full-text search in PostgreSQL
- Using tsvector and tsquery for advanced search
- Ranking and highlighting search results

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement full-text search for a specific dataset.

## Backup and Restore 📦

- Backing up databases using pg_dump and pg_dumpall
- Restoring databases from backup files
- Scheduling automated backups

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Backup and restore a PostgreSQL database.

## Replication and High Availability 🔄

- Configuring replication for data redundancy
- Understanding master-slave and synchronous replication
- Implementing high availability strategies

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Set up replication for a PostgreSQL cluster.

## Mini Project Tasks 🛠️

1. **E-commerce Database**: Design and implement a database for an e-commerce website.

2. **Library Management System**: Create a database for a library to manage books and members.

3. **Social Media Data Analysis**: Perform data analysis on social media data stored in PostgreSQL.

4. **Blog Analytics**: Develop a database and queries for blog post analytics.

5. **Restaurant Reservation System**: Design a database for a restaurant reservation system.
