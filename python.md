- Custom exception classes

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write a program that handles errors gracefully when reading from a file.

## Working with Libraries 📚

- Installing and using third-party libraries with pip
- Exploring popular Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas)
- Integration with libraries in your projects

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Utilize NumPy for mathematical operations on arrays.

## Web Scraping 🕸️

- Understanding web scraping and its tools (e.g., BeautifulSoup)
- Extracting data from HTML pages
- Handling dynamic content (e.g., using Selenium)

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write a web scraper to extract information from a website.

## Data Visualization 📊

- Using data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
