**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Install Rust and write a simple "Hello, World!" program.

## Installing Rust ⚙️

- Setting up Rust environment using Rustup
- Using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build tool
- Upgrading and managing Rust toolchain

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Set up Rust environment and create a new Rust project using Cargo.

## Rust Basics 🦀

- Variables, data types, and basic operations in Rust
- Control flow with if-else, loops, and match statements
- Understanding ownership and references

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement a program to find prime numbers using loops and match statements.

## Ownership and Borrowing 📋

- Rust's ownership model and memory management
- Borrowing rules and references in Rust
- Using slices to work with data

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a function that modifies a list using borrowing and references.

## Enums, Pattern Matching, and Option 🧩

- Defining and using enums in Rust
- Pattern matching with match and if let expressions
- Understanding the Option and Result types

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement a function that returns an Option type for error handling.

## Error Handling ❌

- Rust's error handling with the Result type
- Using the ? operator for concise error propagation
- Creating custom error types

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Refactor previous tasks to handle errors using Result and custom error types.

## Collections and Iterators 📚

- Working with arrays, vectors, and other collections
- Iterating over collections using loops and iterators
- Using closures for flexible data processing

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement a program that performs various operations on collections.

## Functions and Closures 📋

- Defining and calling functions in Rust
- Using closures for encapsulating behavior
- Function pointers and higher-order functions

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create functions and closures for data processing and manipulation.

## Traits and Generics 🎛️

- Understanding traits and how they enable code reuse
- Writing generic functions and data structures
- Associated types and trait bounds

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement a generic stack data structure using traits.

## Concurrency and Multithreading 🔄

- Introduction to concurrency and multithreading in Rust
- Creating and managing threads
- Thread synchronization and communication

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Build a multi-threaded program to demonstrate thread synchronization.

## Asynchronous Programming ⚡️

- Working with async and await for asynchronous programming
- Using async functions and combinators
- Handling errors and cancellation in async code

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Rewrite some code using async functions and handle asynchronous errors.

## File I/O and Error Handling 🗄️

- Reading from and writing to files in Rust
- Handling errors in file operations
- Using the standard library for file I/O

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a program to read and write data to a text file.

## Web Development with Rust 🌐

- Exploring web development frameworks like Actix and Rocket
- Building RESTful APIs and web applications
- Handling HTTP requests and responses

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Develop a basic web application using Actix or Rocket.

## Building CLI Applications 🖥️

- Creating command-line interfaces (CLI) with Rust
- Parsing command-line arguments and options
- Building user-friendly CLI applications

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Develop a CLI application for a specific task or utility.

## Testing and Documentation 📝

- Writing unit tests and integration tests in Rust
- Using test-driven development (TDD) principles
- Documenting Rust code with comments and documentation comments

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write tests for existing functions and document the mini projects.

## Unsafe Rust ❗

- Understanding Unsafe Rust and when to use it
- Working with raw pointers and unsafe blocks
- Ensuring safety with unsafe code

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Use unsafe code to perform low-level operations in a safe manner.

## Rust and C/C++ Interoperability 🔄

- Interfacing Rust code with C and C++ libraries
- Using Foreign Function Interface (FFI)
- Handling data type conversions and memory safety

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Integrate Rust code with a C/C++ library and vice versa.
