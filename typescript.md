## Introduction to TypeScript 🌱

- What is TypeScript and its benefits
- Understanding TypeScript vs. JavaScript
- TypeScript ecosystem and community

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Set up a basic TypeScript project and run it in a browser.

## Setting Up TypeScript ⚙️

- Installing TypeScript with npm or yarn
- Configuring TypeScript compiler options
- Working with tsconfig.json

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a tsconfig.json file and configure compiler options.

## Basic Types and Variables 🔢

- Basic data types in TypeScript (number, string, boolean, etc.)
- Type annotations and type inference
- Variable declarations and scoping

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write a program to find the factorial of a given number using TypeScript.

## Interfaces 📘

- Creating and using interfaces in TypeScript
- Optional and readonly properties
- Extending interfaces and implementing multiple interfaces

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement an interface for a simple "Car" object with properties like make, model, and year.

## Functions 📋

- Typing function parameters and return values
- Optional and default parameters
- Function overloading and arrow functions

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a function that accepts two numbers and returns their sum.

## Classes 🏛️

- Creating and using classes in TypeScript
- Constructors and access modifiers
- Inheritance and abstract classes

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Design a class hierarchy for geometric shapes with methods for area and perimeter.

## Enums 🌐

- Working with enums in TypeScript
- Assigning custom values to enum members
- Using enums with switch statements

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create an enum for the days of the week and display a message based on the current day.

## Generics 🎲

- Understanding generics in TypeScript
- Creating generic functions and classes
- Constraints on generic types

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write a generic function to reverse an array of any type.

## Type Inference 📚

- How TypeScript infers types automatically
- Best practices for type inference
- Cases when type inference might not work as expected

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Explore cases where TypeScript infers types without explicit annotations.

## Modules and Namespaces 📁

- Organizing code with modules and namespaces
- Importing and exporting modules
- Ambient declarations for external libraries

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a module that exports utility functions for string manipulation.

## Decorators 🎭

- Using decorators to modify classes and class members
- Custom decorators and decorator factories
- Popular use cases for decorators

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Implement a decorator to log method invocations in a class.

## Asynchronous Programming 🚀

- Asynchronous operations and promises
- Working with async/await
- Handling errors in async code

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Build a program that fetches data from an API using async/await.

## Working with DOM 🖥️

- Using TypeScript with the DOM
- Type declarations for DOM elements and events
- Interacting with HTML elements programmatically

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Create a simple to-do list application with TypeScript and DOM manipulation.

## Working with Third-Party Libraries 📦

- Integrating TypeScript with third-party libraries
- Type declarations for external libraries
- Writing custom type declarations

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Use a popular library like Lodash or Axios in a TypeScript project.

## Testing 🧪

- Writing unit tests with TypeScript and a testing framework
- Mocking dependencies and testing asynchronous code
- Coverage and test reporting

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Write unit tests for one of your TypeScript classes or functions.

## Build Tools and Bundlers 🛠️

- Building TypeScript projects with webpack or Parcel
- Setting up a development and production build process
- Optimizing and bundling TypeScript code

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Configure a build process for your TypeScript project using webpack or Parcel.

## Framework-Specific TypeScript (e.g., React, Angular) 🚀

- Using TypeScript with popular frameworks (e.g., React, Angular)
- Framework-specific type annotations and best practices
- Advanced TypeScript features for framework development

**Mini Project Task Challenge**: Build a small application using TypeScript with a framework of your choice.

## Mini Project Tasks 🛠️

1. **Task Manager API**: Create a RESTful API for a task manager application using TypeScript.

2. **E-commerce Website**: Build an e-commerce website with TypeScript and a frontend framework.

3. **Real-time Chat Application**: Develop a real-time chat application using TypeScript and a WebSocket library.

4. **Social Media Dashboard**: Implement a social media dashboard with TypeScript and a data visualization library.

5. **Weather App**: Create a weather application that fetches data from an API and displays weather information.
